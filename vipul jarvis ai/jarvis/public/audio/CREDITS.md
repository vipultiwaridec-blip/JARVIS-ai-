## Why not the actual Iron Man score

Disney/Marvel run one of the most aggressive Content ID operations on YouTube.
Real film score or JARVIS dialogue in an upload means a near-certain claim,
demonetisation, or a strike — on a video whose whole point is to be seen. These
tracks are in the same register and cost you a line of text instead.

## Replacing them

Drop in any MP3 with the same filename and it takes over — nothing in the code
references the track names. Other sources worth a look: incompetech.com (same
licence), Pixabay Music (CC0, no attribution at all), and the YouTube Audio
Library.

The short interface sounds — wake pips, tool ticks, the completion chime — are
not files. They're synthesised in Web Audio in `src/lib/sfx.ts`, so there's
nothing to download and nothing to credit. Drop `wake.mp3`, `listen.mp3`,
`tool.mp3`, `done.mp3` or `error.mp3` in here to override any of them.
