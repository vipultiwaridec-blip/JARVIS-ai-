/**
 * Hands.
 *
 * Your hand appears on screen as a skeleton — every joint, every finger — and
 * the tip of your index finger is the cursor. Pinch thumb to finger to press.
 *
 * Drawing the whole hand rather than a floating dot is not decoration. You
 * cannot see your own hand against the screen, so with only a dot you are
 * aiming something whose orientation and shape you have to infer. With the
 * skeleton you can see the pinch closing before it fires, see which finger the
 * cursor is riding on, and see immediately when tracking has lost you rather
 * than wondering why nothing responds.
 *
 * The architectural decision is that nothing here knows what a blade is. No
 * hit-testing of blades, no calls to close or move them, no knowledge of the
 * header you drag by. It turns a hand into a position and a press and
 * dispatches ordinary PointerEvents there — so every interaction the mouse
 * already has works with a hand for free, and anything added later works
 * without being taught that hands exist.
 *
 * The camera is off until you ask for it, says so on screen the whole time it
 * is on, and nothing leaves the machine: the model runs locally on the GPU and
 * frames are read and discarded.
