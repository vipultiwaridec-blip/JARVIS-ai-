/**
 * The camera, and everything that looks through it.
 *
 * One stream, shared. Hand tracking wants it, the camera blade wants it, and
 * looking at something wants it — and a second getUserMedia makes Chrome drop
 * the first, so anything that opens its own would silently blind the others.
 * Everything here goes through one refcounted handle.
 *
 * Three ways of seeing, because "look at this" means three different things:
 *
 *   grabFrame   — one photograph. What is in front of me right now.
 *   watchAhead  — the next few seconds, as a grid. What am I doing.
 *   recentGrid  — the last few seconds, as a grid. What did I just do.
 *
 * The grid is the whole trick for the last two. A model sees images, not video,
 * so a clip has to become a contact sheet: frames sampled evenly, laid out in
 * reading order, each stamped with its offset so the order is unambiguous and
 * the model can talk about timing rather than just contents.
 *
 * Nothing is written to disk and nothing leaves the machine except the single
 * still that a tool call returns. The rolling buffer exists only while the
 * camera is open and is dropped the moment it closes.
