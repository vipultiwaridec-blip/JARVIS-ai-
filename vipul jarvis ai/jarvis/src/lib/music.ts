/**
 * Score.
 *
 * Three cues, all local files under public/audio/:
 *   boot-music — the JARVIS start-up sound, once, as the reactor comes up
 *   ambient    — the opening music, once, alongside it
 *   work       — an industrial cue that loops while a tool is running
 *
 * Only `work` repeats. The other two belong to the power-up and are over when
 * it is: an interface that keeps playing music at you for as long as it is open
 * is one you end up muting, and a muted assistant loses the sounds that
 * actually carry meaning — the wake tone, the tool tick, the completion chime.
 *
 * All of it is Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com), CC BY 4.0 — free to use with
 * attribution and safe on a monetised channel, unlike the actual film score,
 * which would be claimed within a day of upload.
 *
 * Everything degrades quietly: if a file is missing the cue simply doesn't
 * play, and the synthesised bed in sfx.ts covers the ambient case.

 * which is the right rule for a bed that should be running, and completely
 * wrong for a track that has ENDED, because an ended element is also a paused
 * one. Ducking asks for ambient's level every time JARVIS stops speaking, so
 * the opening music was being resurrected from the top after every single
