/**
 * Clap to wake him up.
 *
 * The ignition button exists because browsers will not let a page make a sound
 * until someone has interacted with it. That is still true, so the button is
 * not going anywhere — but there is no reason it should be the only way in, and
 * clapping at a dark room to bring it up is a better opening than clicking a
 * button.
 *
 * A clap is not loud, it is SHARP. Distinguishing it from a door, a cough or a
 * dropped mug is entirely a question of shape: a clap goes from silence to peak
 * in a couple of milliseconds and is gone again inside a tenth of a second.
 * Almost nothing else in a room does both. So this looks for three things in
 * order — quiet before, a near-instant rise, and a fast collapse — and refuses
 * anything that fails one of them. Loudness alone is not evidence.
