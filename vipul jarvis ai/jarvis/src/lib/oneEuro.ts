/**
 * The 1€ filter — Casiez, Roussel & Vogel, CHI 2012.
 *
 * Hand tracking has two problems that pull in opposite directions. A still hand
 * is not still: the landmarks jitter by several pixels a frame, and a cursor
 * that shivers cannot be aimed at anything small. A moving hand needs the
 * opposite treatment: any smoothing strong enough to kill that jitter also adds
 * lag, and a cursor that trails your finger feels broken in a way jitter does
 * not.
 *
 * A fixed low-pass filter — the one-line `x += (target - x) * k` — has to pick
 * one of those to be bad at. This picks neither. It estimates the speed of the
 * signal and adapts its own cutoff to it: smooth hard when the hand is nearly
 * still, barely smooth at all when it is moving fast. Jitter is a problem at
 * low speed and lag is a problem at high speed, and this is the filter that
 * knows which one it is currently facing.
 *
 * Two parameters worth understanding, because they are the entire tuning
 * surface:
 *
 *   minCutoff — the floor. Lower is smoother when still, and slower to respond.
 *               Raise it if the cursor feels sluggish; lower it if it shivers.
 *   beta      — how aggressively the cutoff opens up with speed. Raise it if
 *               fast movements lag behind the hand; lower it if fast movements
 *               feel twitchy.
 *
 * The published tuning advice is to set beta to 0, lower minCutoff until the
 * jitter at rest is acceptable, then raise beta until the lag during fast
 * movement is acceptable. That is how the defaults in hands.ts were chosen.
