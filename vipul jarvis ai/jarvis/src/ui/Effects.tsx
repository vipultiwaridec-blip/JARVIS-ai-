/**
 * One-shot frame effects, fired by JARVIS.
 *
 * These are punctuation, not state: a shockwave when something lands, a tear
 * when something goes wrong. So the overlay only exists while an effect is
 * playing — mounting it permanently would leave a full-frame element in the
 * tree for the entire session for the sake of half a second of animation.
 *
 * Every effect is a CSS keyframe on a freshly mounted node. That is what makes
 * a repeat fire work: `at` is in the key, so asking for 'glitch' twice in a row
 * remounts the node and the animation starts from zero, where re-applying the
 * same class to a live element would do nothing at all.
 *
 * 'shake' is the odd one out. Jolting the frame means moving the HUD itself,
 * which this component does not own, so it borrows it — the class goes on the
 * `.hud` ancestor for the duration and comes off again, including on unmount.
 * A DOM reach-up beats hoisting effect bookkeeping into Hud.tsx just so one of
 * five effects can be expressed as a prop.
