 * Rotating example commands, shown only while idle.
 *
 * A voice interface has no menus — nothing tells you what it can do. This is
 * the affordance. It disappears the moment JARVIS is doing anything, so it
 * never competes with the answer.
 *
 * Each line is phrased the way you'd actually say it, not as a feature name.
