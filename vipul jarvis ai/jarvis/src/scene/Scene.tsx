 * delivered on a re-render, they were delivered late or — before the analyser
 * starts and `level` is a constant zero — not at all, which is why the ignition
 * screen never picked up its own spin rate.
 *
 * Nothing here belongs in React state. The scene is updated by mutation and
 * React only ever mounts it: Rig writes this object once per frame, the
 * children read it in their own useFrame. Children subscribe to the frame loop
 * before their parent does, so they are reading the previous frame's values —
 * one frame of lag on quantities that are all lerped anyway, and invisible.

        Tone mapping is also deliberate, if less obviously so. EffectComposer
        forces gl.toneMapping to NoToneMapping while it is mounted (there is no

        hard clip to white is the neon look this piece wants — the sweep and the

        add a <ToneMapping mode={ToneMappingMode.ACES_FILMIC} /> effect at the
        end of this chain rather than touching the renderer.
