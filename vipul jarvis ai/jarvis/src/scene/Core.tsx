/**
 * The reactor.
 *
 * Modelled on the JARVIS: A Second Screen Experience interface rather than on
 * the suit HUD, because that is the thing this app actually is — an assistant
 * you talk to, sitting idle and listening, not a targeting display. That
 * interface is one big COMPLETE ring: a soft teal torus with a dusty, eroded
 * outer edge and a finely textured disc inside it, on near-black. There is no
 * compass, there are no gauges, and nothing is a broken arc.
 *
 * It is drawn as a single camera-facing plane with a polar fragment shader
 * rather than as geometry. Everything here is a function of radius and angle,
 * which is exactly what a shader is good at, and it means the eroded edge is
 * real per-pixel turbulence instead of a displaced mesh pretending to be a
 * ring — which is how the old build ended up with a lumpy sphere.
