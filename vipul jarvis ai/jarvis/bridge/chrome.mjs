/**
 * JARVIS's hands on your actual browser.
 *
 * Not Playwright. Playwright drives a fresh automation profile: no cookies, no
 * sessions, and a fingerprint that the sites worth visiting recognise on sight
 * — you land on a login wall or a bot check, which is exactly where a voice
 * assistant is least able to help. The browser already sitting on the desk has
 * none of those problems. It is signed in to everything, it looks like a person
 * because it is one, and the pages it can reach are the pages the user actually
 * cares about.
 *
 * Reaching it is the interesting part.
 *
 * The Claude for Chrome extension already speaks to a local process — that is
 * how Claude Code's own browser tools work. The chain is:
 *
 *   Chrome extension  (fcoeoabgfenejglbffodgkkbkcdhcgfn)
 *        ↕  Chrome Native Messaging: 4-byte little-endian length + JSON
 *   chrome-native-host
 *        ↕  Unix socket: /tmp/claude-mcp-browser-bridge-<user>/<pid>.sock
 *   whoever connects  ← this file
 *
 * What Claude Code normally does at that last step is detour through
 * `wss://bridge.claudeusercontent.com`, matching the CLI and the extension by
 * user id and OAuth token in Anthropic's cloud. That hop is the source of most
 * of the "Browser extension is not connected" reports: the socket underneath is
 * healthy and the bridge above it simply fails to authenticate, with no
 * fallback to the socket that was working all along.
 *
 * We are on the same machine as the socket, so we skip the round trip to
 * Virginia entirely and connect to it directly. Nothing about the browser side
 * changes — the extension does not know or care who is on the other end of its
 * native host.
 *
 * The cost of going under a private interface is that it can move. Everything
 * that could break is therefore soft: the socket is re-discovered on every
 * reconnect rather than pinned, an unreachable extension is reported to the
 * model as a plain sentence instead of thrown, and no tool here is required for
 * the rest of JARVIS to work.
 */

/**
 * Where the native host puts its socket.
 *
 * `userInfo().username` rather than $USER, which is unset under launchd — and a
 * bridge started from a login item is exactly the case where a wrong guess
 * would look like the extension being uninstalled.
 */
const SOCKET_DIR = `/tmp/claude-mcp-browser-bridge-${userInfo().username}`

/**
 * How long a single browser action may take.
 *
 * Generous because these are real page loads on a real network, and the failure
 * we are avoiding is not a slow answer but a promise that never settles and
 * silently wedges the turn. A navigation to a heavy site genuinely can take
 * fifteen seconds; a screenshot of it takes a couple more.

 * Find the socket to talk to.
 *
 * The name carries the native host's pid, so it changes every time Chrome
 * restarts and the old file is left behind — picking the wrong one gives a
 * connection that opens successfully and then answers nothing, which is the
 * most confusing failure available. Newest by modification time is the live one.
 *
 * `0.sock` is deliberately deprioritised: it is a symlink some builds create
 * and then fail to update across a Chrome restart, so it is the single most
 * likely file here to be pointing at a host that no longer exists. It is still
 * accepted as a last resort, because on some setups it is all there is.
