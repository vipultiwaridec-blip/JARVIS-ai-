/**
 * The `ui_*` tools — JARVIS's control of his own face.
 *
 * `display` gives him a screen to put things on. This gives him the screen
 * itself: the colour the room is lit in, the size and temper of the reactor,
 * what hangs in orbit around it, which furniture is up, and the occasional
 * flourish. The point is not decoration. An interface that goes red before he
 * says a word, or drops every rail so one photograph fills the frame, is
 * carrying meaning faster than speech can — which is the whole reason a voice
 * assistant has a face at all.
 *
 * The descriptions below are the product. They are the only place the model
 * learns what the interface can be made to do and, more importantly, when it is
 * worth doing — so they are written as direction, not as parameter lists.
 *
 * Like panels.mjs this runs in-process, so a handler pushes straight down the
 * open WebSocket. Every handler emits exactly one message, matching the
 * bridge -> browser contract: { type: 'ui', op, args }.
 */

/**
 * Numbers and booleans arrive however the model felt like writing them — '0.5'
 * as a string, 1 for true, null for "leave it". A turn that fails because a
 * scale was quoted is a turn the user watched break, so nothing here rejects:
 * unions accept the loose forms, `.catch()` swallows the rest as absent, and
 * the handlers clamp into the ranges the browser expects. The worst outcome of
 * a bad value is that it is ignored.

    reading as anything at all.
  - An orbit persists until you take it down. Clear it when the subject
    changes — a suit render still circling during a conversation about mail is

number they need to hold in their head, a moment you want to land. Strip the
chrome, let the screen be quiet, and put it back when the moment is over. The
user cannot restore it themselves, so leaving it off is taking something from

every answer is punctuation, and punctuation stops meaning anything by the third
